We invite <b>short papers</b> of novel or recently published research relevant to the topics of the workshop.
* Short papers are 2+n pages (2 pages content + references)
* Submissions must follow the [IEEE Conference double column format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
* All accepted papers will be presented as posters at the workshop and published on the workshop website.
* Please indicate whether your paper falls into the <strong>‘novel’</strong> or <strong>‘previously published’</strong> category. Novel research papers are encouraged and can expect more substantial review feedback on their work. This is provided as a service to authors of novel papers and does not diminish the chance of acceptance.
* All accepted submissions will be considered for the best presentation award, where 3 finalists will be selected for 10-minute plenary presentations. While all submissions are eligible, novelty will be considered in finalist selection.
* Submissions are single blind and will be reviewed by members of the (extended) workshop committee.
* Submissions can optionally be accompanied by a video.
* <b>All accepted submissions will be considered for three awards: Best Paper, Best Poster, and Best Application/Deployed System, each receiving a 150 USD gift card.</b>

### <strong>Invited topics</strong>
We invite submissions including, but not limited to:
* <b>Geometric Mapping (SLAM/VO, multi-session):</b> How do we get metric, repeatable, globally consistent long-term reef maps without GNSS under refraction/turbidity/lighting change/currents/limited loop closures—and when is pinhole enough vs refractive/ray-based?
* <b>Learning-Based Approaches:</b> How can learning deliver robust reconstruction + cross-session alignment under major change and underwater domain shift/data scarcity/visual degradation—and what reef semantics (morphology, live/dead, algae, rubble, bleaching/disease) should be baked in for monitoring?
* <b>Autonomy and Active Perception:</b> Mission planning, next-best-view strategies, reconstructability prediction, and adaptive behaviors for reef surveys.
* <b>Underwater Scene Representations (NeRF/splatting/implicit maps):</b> What representations best balance metric accuracy, interpretability, scalability, and long-term repeatability for reef monitoring—and how can foundation models and neural scenes (NeRFs, Gaussian splatting, implicit SDFs) be adapted to low-label underwater data to be practical, trustworthy, and usable by marine scientists?
* <b>Multi-Modal Sensing + Fusion:</b> Which sensor combinations (e.g., cameras + imaging sonar/multibeam/SSS, structured light, polarization, hyperspectral/fluorescence, water-quality) and fusion strategies yield reliable reef maps when any single modality fails—and how should suites be designed, calibrated, and deployed for robust underwater perception.
* <b>Benchmarking Strategies for Underwater:</b> Quantitative evaluation methods, uncertainty modeling, and benchmarking frameworks for underwater field experiments.
* <b>From Robotics to Reef Science (field-ready systems):</b> What representations and performance thresholds make reef mapping deployable, and how can robots predict reconstructability, report uncertainty, and adapt via active perception (next-best-view, re-scan, modality switching) as conditions degrade—while supporting scalable evaluation/ground-truthing without traditional reference systems?

<!-- ### <strong>Review Criteria</strong>

Novel submission will be evaluated on:
* Relevance to the topics of the workshop
* Recency and novelty
* Clarity of presentation
* Technical Quality
* Strength of results (i.e., the results show promise for early stage work, the (planned) experimental setup is adequate)

Papers that have previously been published will mainly be evaluated on the first two points (relevance and recency). If so, please mention in the submission where it has been published.

<!-- ### <strong>Call for Demonstrations</strong>
We invite live demonstrations during the poster session. These can either accompany a submitted paper or be standalone. For standalone demonstrations, please submit an up to two pages description and/or video of the demo. Demos will be evaluated on recency and relevance to the workshop.
