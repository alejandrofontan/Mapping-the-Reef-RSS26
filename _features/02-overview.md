Long-term 3D mapping across repeated site visits is a key capability for <b>automating the monitoring of coral reef ecosystems</b>, enabling applications such as structural change detection, ecosystem health assessment, and targeted intervention. Coral reefs are a particularly compelling and challenging domain: they are among the most biodiverse and valuable marine ecosystems, yet are increasingly threatened by climate change and other stressors. Monitoring efforts commonly involve repeated surveys spanning months or years., and converting these observations into reliable, quantitative evidence requires mapping methods that remain consistent across time, conditions, and platforms.

This workshop aims to <b>bring together researchers and practitioners to share, compare, and propose techniques that can enable scalable reef monitoring</b>. We will explore approaches that improve the ability to build useful, repeatable maps of reefs: optical, acoustic, and hybrid reconstruction; SLAM and multi-session mapping; learned and physics-informed representations; semantic and metric mapping; uncertainty estimation and quality assurance; active perception and next-best-view planning; and system-level practices for field deployment. The emphasis is on identifying what works, what fails in the wild, and what new ideas and evaluation standards are needed to turn underwater mapping into a dependable tool for reef science and conservation.
